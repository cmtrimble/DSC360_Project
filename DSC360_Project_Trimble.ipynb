    "Modified By: Caleb Trimble  \n",
    "Description: Creates a preprocessor for normalizing ingested text. Creates a modified version of the corpus model with the preprocessor being called for each of the processes, and applies Pandas Series and apply/lambda to the text for normalization. Runs the corpus normalizer through a large text file, and returns normalized text. Finally returns tokens for the first 1000 values in the document.  \n",

    "This project was a rollercoaster of highs and lows, culminating in a somewhat lackluster ending compared to the effort invested. The objective was straightforward: create an abstract summarizer for news articles. While I technically met this objective early on, the results were initially unsatisfactory, indicating significant room for improvement. I faced various challenges, including compatibility issues that led me to create a new environment, generate a requirements.txt file, and reinstall all dependencies. These setbacks were frustrating but also provided valuable learning experiences in managing project environments and dependencies effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance user input and experience, I implemented modifications such as using the urllib module for encoded multi-word queries and excluding YouTube results due to formatting issues. Initially, the basic query parameters worked fine, but they were limited in handling multi-word inputs. Switching to an encoded query presented challenges, particularly with urllib.parse not identifying proper column names. This issue was resolved by using quote_plus, which correctly encoded multi-word queries. This adjustment significantly improved the flexibility and user-friendliness of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I successfully retrieved the queries, I normalized the articles using a modified preprocessor and normalizer. This step was crucial in ensuring that the text was clean and consistent, which is essential for accurate analysis and summarization. The preprocessing involved removing code snippets, special characters, and unnecessary whitespace, making the text more uniform. Following normalization, I vectorized the results using both CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer. However, the resulting vectors showed little relation in words, with many zero-valued features, indicating sparse matrices. This highlighted the challenge of capturing meaningful features from textual data, especially when the text is diverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I tackled embeddings and Named Entity Recognition (NER). The NER performed well, identifying nouns accurately at a high rate of precision. This was a positive outcome, as it demonstrated the effectiveness of the model in recognizing entities within the text. However, the keyword embedding function struggled with multi-word queries. For example, while the model correctly identified \"Ukraine\" in the vocabulary, it failed to recognize \"Ukraine war.\" This discrepancy pointed to the need for better handling of phrases and compound words within the embedding model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating the summarizer was the most challenging part of the project. Selecting the optimal transformer model from Hugging Face and using a generator to reintegrate stop-words was tricky. I experimented with various models: t5-small was quick and provided moderate accuracy, while t5-base was slower but more precise. Ultimately, t5-large emerged as the best option, offering the highest accuracy despite requiring significant processing power. The choice of model greatly influenced the quality and coherence of the summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "I developed a function to generate summaries, incorporating attributes like input length, maximum length, and minimum length to balance detail and efficiency. To enhance readability, I created another function to inject defining words back into the summaries. This step aimed to improve the fluidity and coherence of the generated text. Additionally, I included source citations in the summaries, allowing users to reference the original articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project was successful in generating clear, source-cited summaries. The results were printed with keywords and sources, providing users with a concise overview of the articles. However, several aspects still require refinement. For instance, the summaries would benefit from proper capitalization of nouns and more consistent integration of stop-words. Some summaries were fluid and coherent, while others were fragmented and incomplete. This variation highlighted the challenge of achieving uniform quality in automated summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while the project met its primary objective, it also revealed areas for improvement. The experience was a valuable learning journey, providing insights into handling textual data, optimizing models, and enhancing user experience. Future iterations of the project will focus on refining the summarization process, improving the handling of multi-word queries, and ensuring more consistent and coherent outputs. Despite the challenges, the project was a significant step forward in developing a functional and flexible summarizer for news articles."
